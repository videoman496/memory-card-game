# Poké-MemoCard

## Overview

This project was created for the [Memory Card assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It features an application built with React where the goal is to click on each Pokémon only once. Every time you click a Pokémon, the order of the cards shuffles, making it increasingly challenging to remember which ones you've already clicked.
